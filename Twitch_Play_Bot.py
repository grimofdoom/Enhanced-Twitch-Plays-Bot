# Written by DougDoug and DDarknut

# Hello! This file contains the main logic to process Twitch chat and convert it to game commands.
# The code is written in Python 3.X
# There are 2 other files needed to run this code:
    # TwitchPlays_KeyCodes.py contains the key codes and functions to press keys in-game. You should not modify this file.
    # TwitchPlays_Connection.py is the code that actually connects to Twitch. You should not modify this file.

# The source code primarily comes from:
    # Wituz's "Twitch Plays" tutorial: http://www.wituz.com/make-your-own-twitch-plays-stream.html
    # PythonProgramming's "Python Plays GTA V" tutorial: https://pythonprogramming.net/direct-input-game-python-plays-gta-v/
    # DDarknut's message queue and updates to the Twitch networking code

# Disclaimer: 
    # This code is NOT intended to be professionally optimized or organized.
    # We created a simple version that works well for livestreaming, and I'm sharing it for educational purposes.

 Rework Info:
     Reworked by GrimOfDoom
     Retains all prior copyright protections and into the future
     This reword was designed to make the programming simpler and reduce rework by the creator (One instance, every game)

           CHANGES
     -TwitchPlays_KeyCodes.py
       -PressKey: instantanious press and release a single key
       -ComboKeysHold: Hold down on a set of keys
       -ComboKeysRelease: Release on a set of keys
       -ComboKeysPress: Press and release instantaniously on a set of keys
       -ComboKeysPressRelease: Press and release a set of keys, with [seconds] wait between hold and release
     -CommandsDef.py
       -Created the file, defines a set of game and command classes used to allow multiple games to select from
         -instead of rewriting every command each time

#                         MAJOR VARIABLES
# MESSAGE_RATE controls how fast we process incoming Twitch Chat messages. It's the number of seconds it will take to handle all messages in the queue.
# This is used because Twitch delivers messages in "batches", rather than one at a time. So we process the messages over MESSAGE_RATE duration, rather than processing the entire batch at once.
# A smaller number means we go through the message queue faster, but we will run out of messages faster and activity might "stagnate" while waiting for a new batch. 
# A higher number means we go through the queue slower, and messages are more evenly spread out, but delay from the viewers' perspective is higher.
# You can set this to 0 to disable the queue and handle all messages immediately. However, then the wait before another "batch" of messages is more noticeable.
MESSAGE_RATE = 0.5
# MAX_QUEUE_LENGTH limits the number of commands that will be processed in a given "batch" of messages. 
# e.g. if you get a batch of 50 messages, you can choose to only process the first 10 of them and ignore the others.
# This is helpful for games where too many inputs at once can actually hinder the gameplay.
# Setting to ~50 is good for total chaos, ~5-10 is good for 2D platformers
MAX_QUEUE_LENGTH = 20
